<p>ðŸŽ‰ So as the only self-identifying fuzztive in the system, I'd best cover this section. </p>
<p>There were two basics I really wanted plural readers to take away from PR#1</p>
<p>One, <strong>Fuzztivity doesn't imply any particular causality</strong> - saying we "come from'' something doesn't instantly mean "brought to existence by it'' - it means stuff like "I was shaken loose by watching this" or "expressing through this look and vibe feels natural and easy" - The rest is left up to you and me. </p>
<p>Fuzztivity brings with it others making a tonne of assumptions. Telling people about your 'source' material character puts you at risk of them forwarding opinions they have of the character onto you. Not telling people leaves you unable to fully express your own personal experiences, and for me at least, can make an introduction to my closest friends feel incomplete.</p>
<p>When someone already familiar with your fictional associate gets to know you, it's important to be allowed to convey your particular interpretation of the character, and which parts resonate with you the most - getting over that assumption barrier can be really tough! and being perceived is an important part of self-development. </p>
<p>Two, <strong>All fictives are fuzztives</strong> to some extent. Anybody that experiences (e.g. fronts, talks) and commits those experiences to memory, even with a causal faith that defines them very strictly, is an immediate mix of foreign and local experiences. </p>
<p>Everyone has a different kind of relation to their (as I would say) fictional associate. I personally find that while mine resonated with me directly a decade ago (long before understanding what I was experiencing), the thing that's continued to resonate with me since then is a strange mishmash of character interpretations in fanfiction (that, for curious reasons, wouldn't even be interpreted as being the same as character even in-story). Contrastingly, I've met plenty of fuzztives that just feel directly like they suddenly "popped out" of their source material and are now living a different life. </p>
<p>Whether you relate loosely from the very start or not, I feel like allowing yourself to reinterpret and reimagine yourself in whatever way feels right - and to let yourself grow and, well, be dynamic - is super <em>super</em> important. </p>
<p>The external things resonated in you - or you may feel grabbed right from those external things, but you own you. You can do whatever the hell you want. Even if Especially if your fictional associate's creators turn out to be huge bitches or ruin the character in canon ðŸ˜Œ</p>
