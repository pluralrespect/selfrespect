# Prickles in Hyper-Individualism

So yeah it turns out that running away from the idea of being a singlet by hyperfocusing on your ability to be Cool and Independent as Fuck as a Singular Headmate that never needs any help from other headmates because you’re Not a Singlet is actually very bad. You’ve just gone and done you a singlet-normativity again but upside down - and as we know, an upside down smiley face is not the same as a frowny face. 

Sometimes all of the coolest stuff in your system is a constant vague collaboration between everyone in it in various amounts - sometimes 90% one and 0.5% everyone else - it doesn’t matter. Point is don’t shut it out. We just got tired all the time, frustrated for the wrong reasons, and shut out our ability to look after and encourage eachother.
