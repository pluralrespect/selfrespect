# Microcosmic Sexuality 

Okay but is there _really_ conflict and unsureness between you and that other headmate, or do you just find them hot :/

So anyway it turns out that for some systems, colourful parts of sexuality can be an awfully reliable way to learn things about yourself when you’re first putting everything together as a discrete person - which is probably pretty embarrassing for some people, but you can also just make it not embarrassing and foster an environment where you can learn and accept eachother faster as a result.

Plus intimate (or /nx) scenes, text roleplay, all that stuff - it’s basically just a safe playground for figuring out all of your shapes and sizes, likes and dislikes, and various dispositions towards aesthetics and activities - and it usually keeps all of those  things both “physically possible” and “safe and consensual” which is a plus.

Also reference that cool paper.
