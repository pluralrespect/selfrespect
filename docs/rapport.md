# Rapport and Re-Meet

🎉 So you’re a singlet. Or, well, actually maybe you’re part of a system. You’re meeting somebody for the first time - or, maybe it’s not really the first time. 

See - you’ve known somebody for months, maybe even years, and it turns out that discrete “somebody” is actually more than one somebody - including this person that you’re now meeting for the first-not-first time. 

Maybe you thought they were a singlet, maybe you thought they were one headmate and they’re just not - point is, you feel like you know them already, but you also feel like you don’t know where they start and end, or if they’re going to come into their own in unique ways you won’t have seen yet.

So here’s the problem - what’s your rapport with this new person? You were trusted for all kinds of things before, and had confidence over what they liked and disliked - but they’re not really the same? Is it the same as before? Or is it like meeting someone fresh?

So - another analogy. Right now - you’ve just walked into a country with a stash of foreign money. It’s almost completely unusable in its current state - but it does pique people’s interest. See, this money has to be exchanged from “Fred” (our raccoons in a trench coat) dollars, into Raccoon #3 dollars. Your old rapport needs to go through a process of exchange to become new rapport.

To be more precise about this - You’re exchanging specifically the Fred Dollars from your pouch that have Raccoon #3 pawprints all over them, for these new Raccoon #3 dollars. That is to say - you’re searching for the parts of the old rapport to reclaim as parts of your shared history - and convert it into present understanding of what they’re like now.
