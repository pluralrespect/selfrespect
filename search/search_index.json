We soon realised that recounting our own and others' experience fighting for self acceptance, and defining concepts like \"singlet-normativity\" five times in a row was a bit hard to track. More importantly, we were concerned that another system might need similar advice, but just not trust us enough to divulge what they were going through. \ud83d\udc09 So, simple enough concept - let's write down all these subjective thoughts and learned understanding and the challenges we faced and understood others to have faced, split them up into readable categories, and boom! \"systemhood is new and confusing and I need to read something about it\": the google doc! \ud83d\udc09 Cool idea, but in practice when writing it we felt the need for our personal experiences to take a back seat to the conclusions they'd brought us to - we were feeling the flaws of the briefness of morethanone when it came to not just making someone aware that we existed - but giving them enough information to do something as complex as say\u2026 be our friend. We formalised and sured up a lot of the concepts, broke things down into logical arguments and simple statements, and we removed any elements attempting to argue against various kinds of sysphobia.

It might seem trivial - how different are systemhood and personhood, after all? But just how hard would it be to learn how to be a person, from scratch? Out in nature with nobody around - Would you even know you were supposed to? The challenge is as strange as \"Just discover fire\" - It's not easy.

Fuzztivity brings with it others making a tonne of assumptions. Telling people about your 'source' material character puts you at risk of them forwarding opinions they have of the character onto you. Not telling people leaves you unable to fully express your own personal experiences, and for me at least, can make an introduction to my closest friends feel incomplete.

Anybody that experiences (e.g. fronts, talks) and commits those experiences to memory, even with a causal faith that defines them very strictly, is an immediate mix of foreign and local experiences.

I personally find that while mine resonated with me directly a decade ago (long before understanding what I was experiencing), the thing that's continued to resonate with me since then is a strange mishmash of character interpretations in fanfiction (that, for curious reasons, wouldn't even be interpreted as being the same as character even in-story). Contrastingly, I've met plenty of fuzztives that just feel directly like they suddenly \"popped out\" of their source material and are now living a different life. Whether you relate loosely from the very start or not, I feel like allowing yourself to reinterpret and reimagine yourself in whatever way feels right - and to let yourself grow and, well, be dynamic - is super super important.
