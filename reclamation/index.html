    <h1 id="repression-and-reclamation">Repression and Reclamation</h1>
<p>üéâ Now bear with us for a moment - the analogy that we‚Äôre going to use for both pre-system repression and for unknowingly crungled headmates is pretty blatant and direct, but we think it‚Äôs easier to realign a simple concept to match someone‚Äôs experience than to make a complex one try to do everything.</p>
<p>So anyway, repression is like being a handful of racoons in a trench coat named ‚ÄúFred‚Äù. And don‚Äôt give me that ‚Äúyou must have big hands‚Äù stuff - this is important. Raccoons in trench coats can do stuff - they can buy movie tickets and sneak into movie theatres, commit crimes, and so on. But in the long run, I think we can all agree it‚Äôs nice to have people in your life that will just shake your grubby little raccoon hands and see you as yourself - maybe even most people.</p>
<p>Now I‚Äôm not super interested in hashing over all the possible weird grimy feelings people and non-people can have about their repressed era - What‚Äôs important to me to talk about is, as a raccoon, being able to point at the time when you got the gang to dumpster dive for discarded popcorn after the movie and go ‚Äúthat was me, I did that!‚Äù. </p>
<p>Repression is a funny thing where often everyone is trying to jump out of the body at all times to breathe - and being able to look back over it and realise who was trying to (and when) can help you better understand and refine who you are now, and give you a tangible sense of history and development. Maybe you were a scene kid - and now you‚Äôre just goth - it‚Äôs character progression.</p>
